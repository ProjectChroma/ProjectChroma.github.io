		<p>Chroma is a puzzle platformer that utilizes the space bar to change the color scheme of the game from dark to light or vice versa. By changing the scheme platforms that had been there before may disappear and new ones can appear in separate areas around the screen. These two separate schemes add a huge new aspect to the classic platformer, because the player now has to work with one scheme while keeping the other in mind to know when the scheme needs to be changed for a beneficial result.</p>
