			<p>Chroma is a 2D puzzle platformer with a unique mechanic: colors. Each color of platform in the level has a unique effect on the player. In addition, gameplay revolves around the ability to change the color scheme of the level throughout. (For an example, press Space!)</p>

			<p>Chroma's primary mechanic involves switching the background color of the game. This controls what platforms are visible - an important mechanic because the player now has to work with one scheme while keeping the other in mind to know when the scheme needs to be changed for a beneficial result.</p>

			<p>Blue blocks will slow the player down to 75% of their normal speed, while orange blocks will speed the player up to 150% of normal. These effects stack with themselves and each other.</p>

			<p>Purple blocks will pull the player towards them, and green will push them away. Using these blocks, gravity can be inverted, rotated, or negated entirely.</p>

			<p>Light blue blocks can be broken on impact, but only if the player is moving very quickly. You'll have to jump from a high place or use green/purple blocks to your advantage to break them.</p>
