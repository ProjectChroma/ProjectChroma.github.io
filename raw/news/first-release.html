		<p>Today, Chroma will be publicly available to play for the first time. The core of the game's systems, a handful of interesting tech-demo levels, and a basic launcher are now publicly available to download and play.</p>
		<p>Chroma is only 23 days old - <a href='https://github.com/ProjectChroma/Chroma/commit/dff6f756d9c7aae6056647b8a790f731ef985502'>the first lines of code</a> were committed on May 3, 2016, and has grown steadily ever since. The two repositories combined contain almost 2,500 lines of code and average eight commits a week.</p>
		<p>You can download the Launcher <a href='/about-game/download'>here</a>. The source code for the launcher is on Github, at <a href='https://github.com/ProjectChroma/Launcher'>ProjectChroma/Launcher</a>.</p>
